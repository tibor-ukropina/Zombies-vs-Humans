# Installation
To install the project, simply download it from GitHub. The main setup is custom and included in the main file.

# Usage
After downloading and setting up the project, you can run the simulation by executing the main file.

# Running the Simulation
Long Simulation: Run the main file with the appropriate parameter for a long simulation.
Short Simulation: Run the main file with the appropriate parameter for a short simulation.
Step-based Simulation: Specify the number of "steps" that will be taken in the simulation matrix.
# Configuration
